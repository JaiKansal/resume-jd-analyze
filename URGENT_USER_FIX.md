# 🚨 URGENT: Fix User Login/Signup Issues

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
Every time you push changes to Streamlit Cloud, the SQLite database is **wiped clean**. This is why:
- ❌ **You can't login** with existing email (user deleted)
- ❌ **You can't signup** with same email (database conflicts)

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE FIX (5 minutes):**

### Option 1: Use Different Email (Quickest)
1. **Try registering with a NEW email address**
2. **This will work immediately**
3. **Use this for testing until PostgreSQL is set up**

### Option 2: Set Up PostgreSQL (Permanent Solution)

#### Step 1: Create Free PostgreSQL Database
1. **Go to https://neon.tech**
2. **Sign up with GitHub** (completely free)
3. **Create new project**:
   - Name: `resume-analyzer`
   - Database: `resume_analyzer`
4. **Copy the connection string** (looks like):
   ```
   postgresql://username:password@hostname.neon.tech/resume_analyzer?sslmode=require
   ```

#### Step 2: Update Streamlit Cloud
1. **Go to your Streamlit Cloud app**
2. **Click Settings** → **Secrets**
3. **Find the DATABASE_URL line and replace it**:
   ```toml
   DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://your-connection-string-from-neon"
   ```
4. **Save secrets**

#### Step 3: Test
1. **App will redeploy automatically** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Register with any email** - it will work
3. **Users will persist forever** - no more loss on deployments

## 🎯 **Why This Happens:**

**Streamlit Cloud Architecture:**
- Uses **ephemeral file system**
- **SQLite files are deleted** on every deployment
- **Only PostgreSQL persists** between deployments

## ✅ **After PostgreSQL Setup:**
- ✅ **Users persist forever**
- ✅ **Login works after deployments**
- ✅ **Analysis history preserved**
- ✅ **No more user conflicts**
- ✅ **Production-ready**

## 🚀 **Current App Status:**
Your app is **working perfectly**! The only issue is user persistence. Once PostgreSQL is set up, everything will work flawlessly.

**Logs show:**
- ✅ App loading successfully
- ✅ "3 analyses remaining" (functionality working)
- ✅ All imports resolved
- ✅ Razorpay payment system ready

**The PostgreSQL setup is the ONLY permanent solution for user persistence on Streamlit Cloud.**
